<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Constantly reminding others to do things is a hassle. Sometimes, when we remember that we need to remind someone of something, it could be the middle of the night which isn't a good time to text someone. That's why I developed this program that suited my needs to send out weekly reminders at specific times so I don't have to do it manually. 

**Note: This program is still very early in it's development and there are multiple things that could be improved on.**

Potential Improvements:
- Users need to edit multiple things in order for the program to suit their situation.
- 2 reminders will be sent out unless changes are made to the code
- Users need to use an external task scheduler to schedule the messages


Potential Additions:
- GUI for Users to key in all the necessary information withouth having to manually edit the code


*For more information, check out RoadMap section below.*

### Built With

* []()Python 3.8.8
* []()Twilio REST API




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Twilio Python Helper Library
  ```sh
  pip install twilio
  ```
  
  
* Twilio account (account_sid, auth_token)


    You will also need to sign up for a [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) account to get a phone number to send the messages from. If you sign up for a trial account, you will only be able to send messages to verified phone numbers on Twilio. However, you can sign up for a paid account for free using the promo code ``` TWILIOQUEST``` which will give you $50 credit.

  ```sh
  https://www.twilio.com/
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JulianTee/MessageReminderBot.git
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

- This program was designed to send out 2 customized SMS reminders to a specific number at a specific time. 

1. Open credentials.py and change the values of ```account_sid``` , ```auth_token``` & ``` twilio_num``` to your personal numbers
2. Enter the recipient(s)'s phone number in the list ```phoneNums```. Make sure to **save your changes** 
3. Open MesBott.py
4. In *Line 8*, enter the file path for weekCount e.g. ```C:/Users/John/weekCount.txt```
5. In *Line 12*, enter the file path for msgCount e.g. ```C:/Users/John/weekCount.txt```
6. In *Line 19 and line 20*, change the content of the SMS message to your desired message
7. If you want to make sure the message is only sent out on a specific day, change the number in *line 49* to a number that corresponds to the day (0 = Monday - 6 = Sunday)
8. Change the if Loop *line 49 to 57* to however number of recipients you have
9. Use Windows Task Scheduler or Cron on Linux to schedule the code to run at a specific time!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

The current iteration is the first ever iteration of this program. 


Potential Improvements:
- **Users need to edit multiple things in order for the program to suit their situation.**
  Potential Fix: Streamline and reorganize code in a way where users do not need to go line to line to change data

- **2 reminders will be sent out unless changes are made to the code**
  Potential Fix: Prompt that allows users to enter the number of reminders they want to send out
  
- **Users need to use an external task scheduler to schedule the messages**
  Potential Fix: Add loop that checks time and date. If it matches the set conditions, the send message function will execute


Potential Additions:
- **GUI for Users to key in all the necessary information withouth having to manually edit the code**
  A Graphic User Interface that has all the needed fields for users to fill out on one page so that the program can be used for their specific scenario.
